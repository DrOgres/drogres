### Howdy 👋
I'm David (He/Him) some folks call me Dr.Ogres (🔍david rogers... d rogers... dr ogers ... get it? I didn't make it up I just liked the way it sounded.😸) and I live in Chicago where I play music, make cheese, art and code.

🔭 I’m currently working on Systems for Foundry VTT specifically Tales From the Loop and Vaesen. I also help where I can with the Free League Developer Community https://github.com/fvtt-fria-ligan

I also do freelance web dev and other programming.

💬 Ask me about cheese or math rock.
